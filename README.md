# Malaria-R-shiny Dashboard
 Data Source has been taken form MALARIA ATLAS PROJECT
The datasets utilized in this project are sourced from the Malaria Atlas Project. They serve to demonstrate the capabilities of R-Shiny dashboards in facilitating data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

Developed: I have developed a dynamic, interactive R-Shiny dashboard that leverages data from the Malaria Atlas Project. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.This R-Shiny dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the data, with features that allow users to filter and visualize the data based on various metrics. The dashboard includes a bar plot that groups data by year, providing a clear overview of trends over time.One of the key features of our dashboard is the use of value boxes. These boxes display the total value for a specific metric, providing a quick and easy way for users to understand key data points at a glance
